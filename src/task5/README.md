# Echo Client-Server Java Application

This project contains two Java programs that implement a simple echo system using sockets:

- **`EchoServer.java`** – A server that listens for incoming client connections and echoes back received messages.
- **`EchoClient.java`** – A client that connects to the server, sends user input, and prints the echoed response.

## How to Compile

Run Server first then client.
