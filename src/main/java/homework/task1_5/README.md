- Contains the class `SortStudentsInUniversity` with a main function that generates a list of students and sorts them either by name or by point average.
- Contains the class `Student` with the desired constructor getter and setter methods.
- Contains my interpretation of the faculty number validation function, although the description is not sufficiently explicit.
For example the result of `mod 11` can be 10 which can not be saved in one digit. Furthermore, the example faculty number from the
exercise sheet is not valid in my interpretation.
